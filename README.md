# Mesos/Marathon sample

## Summary

This project contains everything you need to spin up a Mesos/Marathon service and provides a RESTful API
to Start/Stop useless processes as well as listing one/all running processes.

## Prerequisites

To run this demo you will need the following installed:
 *  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) 
 *  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 
## Getting started

Clone this repository to your computer
